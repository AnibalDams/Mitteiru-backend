# What does this API do?

> [!NOTE]
> **You must have already installed MySQL, flask, and the MySQL Driver for python for the correct functioning of the API**

This API provides you **a variety of routes to build an anime streaming app** (In any platforms). It makes your app able to: 
- create users 
- login
-  update those users' data
-  delete users
-  create profiles
- update profiles
- delete profiles
- create animes
- look at those animes' information
- update those animes' information
- delete a given anime
- add episodes to an anime
- watch that episode
-    Add animes to a list dedicated to each user
- delete those animes from that list
- see the genres that are available in the API
- see what animes have that genre
- see the animes of a certain studio

> [!NOTE]
> **These are the features that are available until a certain point in the development, more features can be added later, and if that is so, they will be listed here**

# Is it usable?

Well, yes, it is usable. I do use it in the project shown in [this repository](https://github.com/AnibalDams/Mitteiru) and it is fully functional in those projects, **BUT these projects are made just for praticing python, Flask, MySQL, Svelte, etc. So I do not reccoment use it in a project that is not just for practicing something.** I do not verify a lot of things, I do not use a token based authentication, I do not use Authorizations headers, I do not encrypt nothing, and more things like that. And of course, surely there are a ton of errors that i did not see when i was coding them.

#### *So, What can i do with this project?*

Nothing but see the code of something that you have not done before and you want to know a way to do it or you have a practice front-end project that fits with this API and you do not want to code a back-end.

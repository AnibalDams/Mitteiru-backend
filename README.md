> **:warning: These are the features that are available till a certain point of the development, more features can be added later, and they will be listed here**


# Is it usable?

Well, yes, it is usable. I do use it in the another project shown in this reepository and it is fully functional in those projects, **BUT these projects are made just for praticing python, Flask, MySQL, Svelte, etc. So I do not reccoment use it in a project that is not just for practicing something.** I do not verify a lot of things, I do not use a token based authentication, I do not use Authorizations headers, I do not encrypt nothing, and more things like that. And of course, surely there are a ton of errors that i did not see when i was coding them.

#### *So, What can i do with this project?*

Nothing but see the code of something that you have not done before and you want to know a way to do it or you have a practice front-end project that fits with this API and you do not want to code a back-endT
